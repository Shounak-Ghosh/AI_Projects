Looking at the results of our final baseline, you may be surprised this approach is working at all–after all, our model is still barely looking at the content of websites. We will further explore the issue of modeling the content of websites tomorrow, but as a result of our efforts today, we now know that we can make progress with a relatively simple approach!"
